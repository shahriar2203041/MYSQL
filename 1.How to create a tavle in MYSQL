Before creating the table, you must first select the schema where you want the table to be created.
For example, if you want to use the shahkuet schema, you should start with:


USE shahkuet;


Then, you can create the table in that schema using the following SQL command:


CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
This will create a table named students inside the shahkuet schema with two columns:

id for storing integer values, and

name for storing text values up to 100 characters.

use desc tablename to view the table contents.
