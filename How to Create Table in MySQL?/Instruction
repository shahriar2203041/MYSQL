Before creating a table, you must first select the schema where you want the table to be created.

For example, if you want to use the shahkuet schema, start with:


USE shahkuet;
After selecting the schema, you can create the table using the following SQL command:


CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
This command will create a table named students inside the shahkuet schema with two columns:

id: for storing integer values

name: for storing text values up to 100 characters

To view the structure of the created table, use:


DESC students;
