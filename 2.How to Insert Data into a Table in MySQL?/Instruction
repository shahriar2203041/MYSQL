To insert data into the students table inside the selected schema (like shahkuet), use the following SQL command:

INSERT INTO students(id, name)
VALUES
(34, 'Rabby'),
(41, 'shah'),
(58, 'saif'),
(90, 'sanjid');
This will add four rows to the students table, each with an id and a corresponding name
