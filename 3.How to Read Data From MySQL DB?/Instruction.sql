To retrieve data from the students table, you can use the following SQL commands:

-- Show all columns and all rows
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Show only name and id columns from all rows
SELECT name, id FROM students;

-- Show all columns from the row where id is 41
SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 41;
These commands will help you view specific or complete data from the students table.
